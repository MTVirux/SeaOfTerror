# Sea of Terror

This is a fork of the Dalamud plugin repo automations of SeaOfStars for my plugins.

## Installing
- Enter `/xlsettings` in the chat window and go to the Experimental tab in the opening window.
- **Skip below the DevPlugins section to the Custom Plugin Repositories section.**
- Copy and paste the repo.json link into the first free text input field.
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MTVirux/SeaOfTerror/main/repo.json
```
- Click on the + button and make sure the checkmark beside the new field is set afterwards.
- **Click on the Save-icon in the bottom right.**

Following these steps, you should be able to see all contained plugins in the Available Plugins tab in the Dalamud Plugin Installer.
No Plugins will be installed, you have just made them available. You can now select which of these plugins you actually want to install.
